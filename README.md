# Hi there, I'm Arka Maitra 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on web technologies, AI, and scalable system design. I enjoy building robust applications, exploring cutting-edge tech stacks, and contributing to meaningful open-source projects.  

Beyond coding, I love diving into philosophical discussions, learning about human psychology, and capturing life's moments through photography. I believe technology is most powerful when it enriches human experiences.
